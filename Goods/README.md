#Goods

##Design Guide

A Good card should have at least one side to the card but may have two. In example:

```
You may have an indigo card on one side and ink on the reverse side since these two resources are linked together.
```

Every good card should have a visual reference to the [settlement feature](../SettlementFeature) that enables the good.
