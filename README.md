# Game Mission

# New World

This is the base game for the Governor Board Game system.

Islands have been discovered in a brave new world. Tales of wealth and fertility have spread across Europe. The nobility is in a race to carve out control over this exciting land.

Longing for adventure and a better life, you have gained favor with your king's court and been given a commission to govern a small settlement in the New World.

Be decisive, forge alliances, engage in intrigue, and weather adversity to grow your territory and gain favor with the king's court. The king will surely notice your efforts and knight you.

Two players cannot settle within 4 hex positions of each other.

Resolve conflict in Round 0 by sacrificing favor, a negative value of favor is possible. the person sacrificing the most favor would get first choice. Losing parties would not lose favor.

The Actions phase is a timed phase. Start the 5 minute timer when the passage of time phase is finished and players are ready.

Actions are performed as follows: Discard a queued event card face down, then you may perform an action. Every action must be unique per round.
