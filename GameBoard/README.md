#Game Board

##Design Guide

Every board should have a land and a water area to them. No land mass should be less than 10 [hexes](../Hex) of playable terrain.

Every board should have at least 3 [fertilities](../Fertility).

###Layout

Should be a map of [hexes](../Hex) covering the whole board with exact half hexes on every edge of the board.

###Size

Game board size should be able to be produced with regular sheets of paper. You may use 1 or two sheets of paper in your design.

Every board [hex](../Hex) should match the standard size of 1" from point to furthest point.
